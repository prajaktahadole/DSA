// Hostel & Warden 

// Description
// It's party time in a hostel, and you are partying with your friends in the hostel's lobby. You can visualise the lobby as a 1-dimensional line (x-axis). All of you are scattered along that X-axis. Suddenly, you come to know that the warden is coming to the hostel. So, all of you want to hide inside a room. So, you will be given x-coordinates of hostel rooms as well as your current location (as x-axis coordinate). Anyone can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x -1. Any of these moves consume1 minute. You have to find out the minimum time in which everyone in the lobby can go to any room and hide inside.


// Input
// Input Format
// First line of input contains N whichis the total number of students present in the lobby
// Second line contains N space-separatedintegers representing current x-coordinates of students scattered in lobby
// The third line also contains N spaceseparated integers representing x-coordinates of the rooms present in the lobby

// Constraints
// N <= 1000000
// -1000 <= x[i] <= 1000

// Output
// Print the minimum time as per the given condition in question

// Sample Input 1 
// 3
// 4 -4 2
// 4 0 5
// Sample Output 1
// 4

// Hint
// Sample 1 Explanation
// Assign student at position x = 4 to room at position x = 4 : Time taken is 0 minutes
// Assign student at position x=-4 to room at position x = 0 : Time taken is 4 minutes
// Assign student at position x=2 to room at position x = 5: Time taken is 3 minutes
// After 4 minutes all of the students are in the rooms. Since, there is no combination possible where the last student's time is less than 4,
// So, answer = 4.
